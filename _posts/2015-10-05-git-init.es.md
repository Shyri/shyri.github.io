Hi there!

Welcome to my blog. Here I will post anything that goes through my head, but mostly software and hardware stuff. I know, there are tons of blogs about software development, how to start programming this or that language. I won't rewrite what other people have alredy done. I like to mess around with code and try uncommon things so hopefully you'll find something interesting here. 

I'd love to read your comments, and don't hesitate to correct me if anything you find here is wrong.

Enjoy!
